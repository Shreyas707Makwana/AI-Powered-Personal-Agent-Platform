# Frontend UI/UX Overhaul â€” Deliverables

This document summarizes the UI/UX work completed, files changed/added, and how to test locally. No backend logic or API contracts were modified.

## Highlights
- Minimal dark theme with subtle shadows; neon glows reduced.
- Consolidated tools in left sidebar and wired to Chat modals via event bus.
- Landing page refreshed with hero, metrics, features, testimonials, footer.
- Analytics page with KPI cards, charts (demo data), and CSV export.
- Responsive layout with mobile drawers and a desktop collapsible sidebar.
- Documentation and testing checklist included.

## Files changed or added

### Theme and shared
- `src/app/globals.css`
  - Added minimal dark theme overrides: surfaces, text, borders, shadows.
  - Reduced neon glow effects across cards, buttons, inputs, and message bubbles.
  - Calmer focus states; reduced motion fallback for heavy background effects.

- `src/lib/toolBus.ts` (existing)
  - Simple global event bus to open Weather and News tool modals from anywhere.

### Landing & App
- `src/app/page.tsx`
  - Public landing page: updated hero copy, added compact metrics strip, kept features/testimonials/footer.
  - Preserves auth redirect logic.

- `src/app/app/page.tsx`
  - Mobile menu now includes Weather/News tool shortcuts that trigger modals via `toolBus`.
  - Added desktop collapsible sidebar with persisted preference in `localStorage`.
  - Chat column expands to full width when collapsed.

### Analytics
- `src/app/analytics/page.tsx` (new)
  - KPI cards (demo data), sparkline and bar chart (SVG), CSV export button, and link back to `/app`.

### Docs
- `TESTING_UI.md` (new)
  - Step-by-step manual testing instructions for landing, app, tools, modals, analytics, and theme.

- `DELIVERABLES.md` (this file)
  - Summary and file-by-file list.

## Local testing quickstart
- From `frontend/`:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
- Visit:
  - `/` for landing (logged-out)
  - `/app` (requires login)
  - `/analytics` for analytics demo

## Accessibility & Responsiveness
- Focus outlines visible for keyboard users.
- Cards/buttons/inputs use subtle borders and shadows.
- Prefers-reduced-motion disables heavy animated backgrounds.
- Mobile: Upload/Archive drawers; Tools shortcuts in menu.
- Desktop: Collapsible sidebar; Chat grows to full width.

## Notes
- No backend/API changes; existing environment variables unchanged.
- ESLint warning about `<img>` in Chat remains low priority.
